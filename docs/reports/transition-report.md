## Full meeting transcript

**Fyodor:**  
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:02,099  
... and this is my ...

**Alexey:**  
00:00:02,099 --> 00:00:04,039  
I don't know.

**Fyodor:**  
00:00:04,039 --> 00:00:26,180  
Uh- How'd you wish Hm? As you wish. Okay, the right one. Now, on this one, what's up... There's Okay, let's start. Uh, first question, is the product complete? Which parts are done and which not done yet?

**Alexey:**  
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:52,500  
Okay. I cannot say that it's, uh, fully completed, right? Because, uh, there is still some, some parts are not connected to, and to some maybe full paths cannot be, uh, actually be finished, right? But still, I see good progress.

**Fyodor:**  
00:00:52,500 --> 00:01:16,440  
Mm-hmm. Uh, okay. So it's the full answer, I guess. Yeah? Yep. Okay. Uh, then the second, uh, question is, are you using the product? How often? In what way? If not, why not? I guess it's not a relevant question because of- Mm-hmm ... the previous answer. Yeah, yeah. So let's move on. Uh, has the customer deployed the product on their site? Also is not relevant just because of first answer.

**Alexey:**  
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:33,919  
Yeah, but I maybe would like to try. I mean, that's, uh, it is important to check if it's, uh, really simple to deploy it, because sometimes it's maybe a nightmare to, uh, set up the environment and check maybe is it working for my hardware, because, you know, sometimes some people using Windows, some people are using Mac. Uh, and for me it's, uh, Linux, so maybe it's somehow differently.

**Fyodor:**  
00:01:33,919 --> 00:02:09,619  
Yeah, but I maybe would like to try. Uh, so you really want to try it even before it's completed?

**Alexey:**  
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:37,499  
I mean, uh, you will add some functionality inside some packets, uh, pack- packages, right? So it's simply like you... the... How to say it? This deployment view is pretty much stable right now, right? So, uh, you have something, I believe, containers that I already can deploy somewhere, try to deploy with.

**Fyodor:**  
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:39,619  
Uh, yeah, we have.

**Alexey:**  
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:54,159  
So maybe I will try to do it. I believe that you already have an instruction inside your, uh, read- readme file, right?

**Fyodor:**  
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:12,359  
Uh, well, actually I didn't understand the full answer, maybe because of, uh, problem- Noise ... quality. Can you extend an answer? Our answer.

**Alexey:**  
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:33,759  
Okay. So I would like to try. I believe that, uh, you, uh, already have some, uh, containers that I can actually, uh, start and use them, yeah, on my machine just to check that everything is smoothly. And I believe that you have, uh, readme f- some instruction in readme file to, to make it, right?

**Irina Perekrestova:**  
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,419  
Uh, yeah, we have.

**Fyodor:**  
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:47,259  
Yes, we do. Our Wait. We can actually send it right now.

**Alexey:**  
00:03:47,259 --> 00:04:01,979  
Yeah. Maybe if we did. Mm-hmm. I've sent. Huh. Thank you. Is it accessible?

**Fyodor:**  
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:57,059  
Let me check. Okay. All right.

**Alexey:**  
00:04:57,059 --> 00:05:12,359  
Then I guess... That connection is not the best, let's say. But okay, maybe while it's loading, let's move on. Huh? Can what?

**Fyodor:**  
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:27,639  
While this is loading, let's move on. Oh, okay. Uh, what measures need to be taken to put the transition in the product? Uh.

**Alexey:**  
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,659  
Yeah, it's, I guess, a relevant question.

**Fyodor:**  
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:39,799  
Relevant? Yeah, relevant. What measures need to be taken?

**Alexey:**  
00:05:39,799 --> 00:06:00,939  
Well, I think we already discussed that. Uh, it's good if we will have some real data there, right? Uh-huh. And I believe that you have already implemented, uh, the import functionality in some extent, right? Important functionality.

**Fyodor:**  
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:04,699  
Import. We- I mean. ... import. Yeah. We have already done.

**Alexey:**  
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:40,419  
... rate or rates or maybe it is one of the parts because yo- you know, that's, I, uh, that I will u- use, uh, the system with some historical data and it's important for me to upload it, uh, well, smoothly without some delays and yeah. Okay. Okay. So that is one thing. Measures.

**Fyodor:**  
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:41,103  
Measures.

**Alexey:**  
00:06:41,103 --> 00:06:51,963  
Uh, mm, uh, again, what? Hmm. Uh, I- I'm trying to get the question. So measures like as, like as ... or is, or some-

**Irina Perekrestova:**  
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:53,963  
Okay.

**Alexey:**  
00:06:53,963 --> 00:07:19,243  
Okay. So you use it. Yeah. I think, uh, that one thing is data, the another thing, it's, uh, SSO, but I mean, for now we may use it, uh, in some light mode, let's say, and then m- and then maybe whe- when this SSO part will be available, it's also something that is important.

**Fyodor:**  
00:07:19,243 --> 00:07:22,483  
Yeah. It's in progress. Hmm.

**Alexey:**  
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,583  
Yeah. Depends on university only. Yeah.

**Fyodor:**  
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:50,483  
For now. Okay. Uh, then can we move on to the next question, I guess? Mm-hmm. Uh, what are your plans for the product after its delivery? Are they going to continue? Are you going to continue working on it? And would you like to continue collaborating with the team and on what conditions?

**Alexey:**  
00:07:50,483 --> 00:08:12,684  
Um, I think, uh, yeah, I would like to continue working on the project, uh, on project. And actually, uh, of course depending, uh, o- I mean, with the same team, right? Uh, depending on their availability because as I understood not all maybe people would like to proceed, right? So that's why, yeah.

**Fyodor:**  
00:08:12,684 --> 00:08:30,463  
Mm-hmm. I'll say yes. And we will see who, how it may be in the future. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Uh, then

**Alexey:**  
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:41,643  
the next question, how to increase the chance that it will be useful for you after the final delivery?

**Fyodor:**  
00:08:41,643 --> 00:09:02,643  
Well, maybe I didn't get the question correctly. Can you repeat it? How to increase the chance that it will be useful after the final delivery? Hmm.

**Alexey:**  
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:15,904  
Well, cannot answer the question. Maybe, you know, that's if I will, I- I will able to do the, some scenario through the, hmm, through the

**Fyodor:**  
00:09:15,904 --> 00:09:27,124  
application will be somehow increase the chance. Because for now, I still see some separate parts and it will be good to see how can we collect these parts.

**Alexey:**  
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:43,904  
You mean, it- it requires complete version, not separate parts to- Y- you know, it's more about user scenario. I mean, that's, uh, actually as a user, I would like to do some job, let's say inside this application, right?

**Fyodor:**  
00:09:00:00,019 --> 00:10:19,819  
Mm-hmm. Some work. And actually, mm, if I can do it completely, of course, uh, it increases, uh, ch- uh, chances that I may use it. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. Uh, and for now, separate section for README file. I've already sent the link and questions related to README file.

**Alexey:**  
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:35,579  
First question, is everything clear in README and what can be improved? [coughs] For some reason still... Okay, it is.

**Fyodor:**  
00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:43,959  
Um- Still. I mean, it's fine. Let me che- let me check the readme file. Right.

**Alexey:**  
00:10:43,959 --> 00:11:15,599  
[coughs] And I- I see some ǃɅɅs, context diagram, right? Uh- I see that there is some ǀʊᴍor. Yeah, kinds of users. Yeah, yeah, but first, first instance is just a user. Well- It's like any user of any kind can- ... access Uh- those features? Uh, I see, I see. Usually, you can use some, uh, relation in, like, uh, generalization that help combine them all, all users. Okay. Uh-huh. So, if I would like to deploy it to my machine, what should I do? Hmm, read usage instructions, I guess. Mm-hmm. Click. No, no. I, I mean, usage is about how to use the, the software, but if I would

**Irina Perekrestova:**  
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:36,319  
like to deploy.

**Alexey:**  
00:11:36,319 --> 00:12:18,019  
Deploy, just, uh, read section assessing the application and... follow instructions. It's about deploy. Hmm. Not deploy, but installation. You want more precise instructions? I see follow the link ǀǀ ǀʋ. Maybe something in the doc developments. ... ǀǀ ǀʋ Can't find it. Maybe can you, can you provide the link? Can we provide the link? The- the exact link?

**Fyodor:**  
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:24,519  
The exact link? Hmm.

**Alexey:**  
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:57,239  
To deploy ǀǀ ǀʋ, I mean? No, no, no. The, so instructional deployment. Instruction on deployment. Yeah, we should add in because for now we don't have it. Okay, okay, yeah. Okay. Yes, maybe something that is missing right now. So I would like to have it to ǀǀ ǀʋ the deployment. Thanks.

**Fyodor:**  
00:12:57,239 --> 00:13:09,359  
Also, we may add some structures of, uh, file, let's say. I mean, that we are uploading some i- import things, right? So just to understand what should I upload there?

**Alexey:**  
00:13:09,359 --> 00:14:07,379  
Import file, you mean, when you try to import, uh, data from previous years? Yeah, yeah. Um, instructions ǀǀ ǀʋ. Yeah. [clears throat] It's a valid point.

**Fyodor:**  
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:18,739  
It's a valid point but for now, uh, import file is connected to functionality which is not implemented yet- Uh-huh ... so that maybe it's not valid for now.

**Alexey:**  
00:14:18,739 --> 00:15:01,359  
Okay. Okay. And maybe if something that may be important and some instruction or some desc- description, how can I, uh, do some backup because I'm really, uh, afraid to lose some data, to- to miss some data? So maybe something like that? Mm. Something to, uh... how to say in English? Oh, difficult.

**Fyodor:**  
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:10,479  
What- what do you would like to see? Hmm. Actually, um... ǀǀ ǀʋ.

**Alexey:**  
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:12,899  
Okay.

**Fyodor:**  
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:13,619  
ǀǀ ǀʋ.

**Alexey:**  
00:15:13,619 --> 00:16:17,671  
Okay. So, uh, the idea is that I'm afraid to lose some data, right? So, uh, if, ooh, something wrong... if something went wrong, so, well, I may lose some data regarding some location, getting some history things and stuff. And, uh, from one side, I- I can upload a few... some file from the previous years, right? But I still may miss some information, may lose some information, uh, for the current year. That's mean that, uh, if I- I, ooh, have some function that helps me to- to make some backup and maybe some-... restoring things and, or something like that, maybe even better. And maybe there is some, yeah, well, instruction in the readme how, how can I do this backup stuff.

**Fyodor:**  
00:16:17,671 --> 00:17:10,372  
So, you mean backups by not importing, but also exporting data from our application to Google Sheet bank? As- I see. It's not important, the form that, uh, it will be stored. Maybe it's some binary file that I'm, I may restore, or, you know, that's you may be doing some snapshot of your database or something. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, o- okay.

**Alexey:**  
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:32,991  
Just to think about it and if you can provide some information on it. Uh, it's, it's a good point. Hmm. Maybe even in progress, but, but, okay. We'll be Okay. Mm-hmm. It'll be later.

**Fyodor:**  
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:51,311  
Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay, next question. Uh, where are questions? Yeah, here it is, uh... Hmm, I guess so, because you're ans- have answered all questions about readme.

**Alexey:**  
00:17:51,311 --> 00:18:00,872  
Yeah, yeah. And not asking so that's, that's all.

**Fyodor:**  
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:07,011  
Okay, good. Well,

## Meeting summary

### 1. Product Completion Status
- **Is the product complete? Which parts are done and which aren’t done?**
  - The product is not fully completed. Some parts remain unconnected, and certain full paths are not yet finished. However, good progress has been noted.

### 2. Customer Usage
- **Is the customer using the product? How often? In what way? If not, why not?**
  - The customer is not currently using the product due to its incomplete state, rendering this question irrelevant at this stage.

### 3. Customer Deployment
- **Has the customer deployed the product on their side?**
  - Deployment has not occurred due to the product’s incomplete status. However, Alexey expressed interest in attempting deployment to test its simplicity across different operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux). Containers are believed to be available for deployment, with instructions in the README.

### 4. Measures for Full Transition
- **What measures need to be taken to fully transition the product?**
  - Key measures include implementing real data import functionality for historical data to ensure smooth uploads without delays. Additionally, Single Sign-On (SSO) support is desired, potentially in a lightweight mode initially, with full implementation later, depending on university requirements.

### 5. Post-Delivery Plans and Collaboration
- **What are the customer’s plans for the product after its delivery? Are they going to continue working on it? Would they like to continue collaborating with the team and on what conditions?**
  - Alexey expressed interest in continuing to work on the project post-delivery, preferably with the same team, contingent on team member availability. Future collaboration will depend on who is available to continue.

### 6. Increasing Post-Delivery Usefulness
- **How to increase the chance that it’ll be useful after the final delivery?**
  - Ensuring the product supports complete user scenarios, rather than disconnected parts, is critical. A fully functional application that allows users to complete tasks seamlessly will increase its usefulness.

### 7. Customer Feedback on README
- **Is everything clear? What can be improved?**
  - The README is generally clear but lacks specific deployment instructions. Alexey noted a context diagram and user types but suggested using generalizations to clarify user roles.
- **Are they able to launch/deploy using your instructions?**
  - Current instructions focus on usage rather than deployment. Alexey couldn’t find clear deployment instructions and requested a specific link or section for deployment guidance.
- **What two other sections would the customer like to be included in the README?**
  - **Deployment Instructions:** A detailed section on how to deploy the application, addressing setup across different environments.
  - **Backup and Restore Instructions:** Guidance on backing up and restoring data to prevent data loss, including details on file formats (e.g., binary files or database snapshots) and processes for current and historical data.
